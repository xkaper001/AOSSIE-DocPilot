# Code of Conduct 📜

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the DocPilot community, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards 🌟

- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being patient with newcomers** and helping them learn

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations 🏥

Given DocPilot's focus on healthcare technology, we also emphasize:

- **Patient Privacy**: Never share or discuss real patient information in any community spaces
- **Medical Accuracy**: Be responsible when discussing medical concepts; always defer to qualified healthcare professionals
- **Accessibility**: Consider the needs of users with disabilities in all contributions
- **Data Security**: Take security seriously in all discussions and contributions
- **Professional Standards**: Maintain the high standards expected in healthcare technology

## Enforcement Responsibilities 👮‍♀️

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope 🌐

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Process 🔍

### Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: [Maintainer contact information to be added]
- **GitHub Issues**: For public concerns that don't involve personal conflicts

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Investigation
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
